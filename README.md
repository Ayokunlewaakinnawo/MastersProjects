# Prediction of Diabetes mellitus with machine learning

Diabetes mellitus s a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia. It may cause many complications. According to the growing morbidity in recent years, in 2040, the worldâ€™s diabetic patients will reach j642 million, which means that one in every ten adults in the future is suffering from diabetes. There is no doubt that this alarming figure needs great attention. With the rapid development of machine learning, machine learning has been applied to many aspects of medical health. In this study, we used a decision tree, random forest and neural network to predict diabetes mellitus

In this Project we carried out several task of cleaning up, analysing and training the dataset. Finally, the predictive model used are Logistic regression and decision tree, the models implemented into a target dataset.
